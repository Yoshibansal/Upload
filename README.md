# Upload

Want to share a large number of files over the local network? `Use UPLOAD`. 
Upload creates a private server onto your local/home network. Which means you can share files within your network easily, faster, privately and much more securely.
There are no limits. 

You can also customize your server webpage if you know little bit of HTML and CSS. Don't wary if you don't know. You can just start the server using following commands.
